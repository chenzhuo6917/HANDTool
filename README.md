# HAND
A new terrain model named Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND) has been introduced by Nobre et al. (2011b), defined as "a drainage normalized version of a Digital Elevation Model. The z axis variable of the HAND model is the normalized local height, deﬁned as the vertical distance from a hillslope surface cell to a respective outlet-to-the-drainage cell, i.e., the difference in level between such cells that belong to a mutually connecting ﬂowpath".
